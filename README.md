SublimeDocker
=============

This repository was used during the [Paris Docker Hackathon (12-15 December 2014)](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Paris/events/218767688/). We have then moved the code to a [new repository](https://github.com/l0rd/sublime-docker) where it is actively developed.
This sublime text plugin text plugin has been integrated in Package Control and can be found [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Docker%20Based%20Build%20Systems).
